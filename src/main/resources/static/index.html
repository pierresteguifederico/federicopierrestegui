    <!-- New Section for Projects -->
    <section class="section projects" id="projects">
        <h2 class="title">My Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are a few of the projects I've previously worked on:</p>
        <div class="box-container">
            <div class="box">
                <h3>"PipiCucu Food"</h3>
                <p>It was my first project working as part of a team on an emulation project. Initially, it was meant to be a ten-person team with different roles, but in the end, we were just three people covering all the roles.
                    As a first-year student, I had little experience, but I pushed forward, helping to build an MVP that we presented at "Demo Day" alongside 20+ teams. 
                    It was nerve-wracking, but I learned a lot about agile methodologies, teamwork, Spring Boot, MVC, and other concepts that the following year I encountered in subjects like System Analysis II and Web Applications.
                    The project was about a web app for food delivery (for restaurant owners and customers).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>"Sales Management"</h3>
                <p>Later on, I took an online course about SpringBoot to enhance and solidify my knowledge and concepts, and made a sales management web app. 
                    I developed a RESTful web page that implemented full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Spring Boot. This application allowed users to load, modify, and delete resources through RESTful APIs. 
                    Additionally, I created the front-end of the page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to consume these APIs, ensuring a seamless interaction between the client and the server.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>"Library Management"</h3>
                <p>I also created a library management application, which allowed performing CRUD operations on books. This time, the project was a console-based application using SQLite as the database. I implemented design patterns such as Dependency Injection, Single Responsibility, and the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern to ensure scalability and maintainability. 
                    Additionally, I used JUnit to write unit tests and ensure the application's functionality and stability.

    <section class="section sau" id="sau">
        <h2 class="title">Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Here are the things I like to do in my free time:</p>
        <div class="box-container">
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Playing Chess</h3>
                <p>It helps me develop strategic thinking, sharpen my mind, and blend logic and creativity.
                     Additionally, it teaches me how to deal with defeat and respect my opponent.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Playing Music</h3>
                <p>I love music. I play guitar.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Mountain Biking</h3>
                <p>It keeps both my mind and body healthy, and it also gives me a sense of camaraderie with the people I ride with.</p>
